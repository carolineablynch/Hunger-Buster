# Hunger-Buster

## Overview

This application was created to help those who never knows what they want to eat. With Hunger Busters, we help you decide everything with a click of a button. When you click the random food button, you are presented with a random food photo. After the photo has appeared on the page, three restaurants in your location would appear on the page. The restaurants change depending on which cuisine is showed in the image. When you are satisifed with your random food selection, you are then able to send a copy of the restaurants to your email.
